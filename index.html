            <p>
                A commander with a vision. A living weapon disguised as nobility. A scholar bound by a pact. A flower feeding on hatred. An exile who devours without hesitation. A man willing to sacrifice everything.
                <br>They should never have met, but so they did. Their reasons are their own, yet they stand side by side. 
                In a world where power should dictate worth and blood fuel ambition, they carve their path through civilization and savagery alike. After all, what is the difference between man and monster?
                <br>They are not heroes, nor are they martys. But if the world must burn for their ideals, then so be it.
