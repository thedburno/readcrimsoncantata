    <div class="div1">
      <p class="ps3"><br /></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Dismissed!”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">His soldiers saluted. A simple gesture—raising the dominant arm and curving the other over the chest. Each went their separate ways, maybe home or to the closest tavern.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao took his leave too, calmly walking to his car, greeting some colleagues along the way while many saluted. He checked the mirrors, the seat’s position and carefully put his coat over the passenger seat.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Another normal day, nothing special. Looking after his legion, planning the drills, checking for any suspicious activities… the usual and boring. He sighed. Fortunately, the traffic wasn’t bad—or rather, didn’t even exist yet in Toden. Yao and the other commanders were the only ones that were gifted a car, royal family aside, of course, as part of an agreement. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Soon, he reached his apartment. It looked like any other, if not for the organization of everything. The furniture was equidistant—unless there was a reason not to be—the decorations were arranged precisely, everything in its place—millimetrically perfect. And, above all, spotless. Not only were the walls an almost blinding white, but also he refused to leave the smallest peck of dust even in the most hidden corners.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao quickly went to the kitchen, taking some leftover meat and putting the tray in the oven. He set the temperature and timer so it would be ready once he finished his shower, something he had perfected through experience. Turning it on, he grabbed some clothes from the wardrobe and left.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Thinking about it, he could have stopped by a tavern on the way, chosen something, and eaten there or in the car without much of a hurry. But there were some risks. The food might have been too greasy or the smell of alcohol could cling to his uniform. Even worse, the grease could spill on it or some drunken fool might have stumbled and spilled beer on him. In the worst case scenario, the food’s quality could be so poor it would make him sick, causing him to be late to his destination.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yes, that was the right choice.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">He turned the shower off, quickly dried himself, and put his clothes on before heading back to the kitchen. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><em><span class="s4">Ding!</span></em></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Perfect temperature. The meat was heated evenly, ready to be assembled into a meal. Just some slices of bread, firefruit paste, the meat and a few vegetables.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao spread the right amount of paste on each slice, layered the meat evenly and topped it off with the fresh greens. He just had to roll it up and it was done. A quick, easy snack that didn’t require any culinary expertise yet was enough to keep him going until he could eat properly later after his meeting. He brushed his teeth, checked if the coat was free of any creases, quickly looked for the rune pouch and once again went to his car.</span></p>
      <p class="ps5"><br /></p>
      <p class="ps4"><a id="doc2"></a><span class="s3">It wasn’t that big of an estate—especially for the nobles’ standards—but it was bigger than most of the ones owned by rich merchants. A small, impeccable garden, an outdoor leisure area and finally, taking up at least 70% of the total space, the manor. All of that protected by a metal fence so low that even a first-time thief could jump it, making no attempt to hide its luxury. He stopped by the gate and rang the door phone.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Yes?”, answered a lifeless male voice.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Good night, it’s Commander Yao Weiz,” he answered with the contrasting light voice of always.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Oh, Commander! Do come in.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">The gates opened.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">A servant was already standing by the mansion’s open door. The same one that answered the intercom, Yao deduced, as it had the decrepit look that was expected of someone with that voice. Working there might have sucked the life out of him. The servant made a light bow, unnecessary but possibly customary. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">He guided Yao through the extensive halls until they reached a double door around half the size of the entrance gates. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Excuse me, lady Isabeau,” the servant said, opening the doors. “Master Weiz has arrived.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">As expected, the room was spacious and filled with different furniture and paintings. Yao’s eyes didn’t linger on them, however, and went straight to the one who invited him.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Commander,” the woman greeted as she rose from her seat. “I’m grateful to you for coming.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She extended a handshake, her smile the same practiced one seen at noble gatherings—neither warm nor cold, merely rehearsed.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“There’s no need to say so,” Yao replied, returning the gesture with his best controlled smile.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Would you like some water? Coffee or tea, perhaps?” The servant interrupted.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Water is fine. Now that I think about it, I don’t think I drank enough today…”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">The servant left.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“I take it your duties must take a lot from you,” Isabeau commented.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Oh, you have no idea. Would you believe the General-Prince had us monitoring the live border maps? I only left the room at lunchtime and again when it was time to send my legion off.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Isabeau chuckled. He lied, something he had been improving as he interacted more with people like her, but it was said convincingly enough.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“By the gods, that must have been dreadful… but was he suspicious of anything? Any unusual movements?”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“None at all. It was likely to…”, he paused. “…actually, I have no idea.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She laughed.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“My, how rude of me!”, she suddenly exclaimed, stopping her laughter. “Please, sit, Commander. Surely you are exhausted from standing up all day.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Isabeau motioned to a seat near the couch she had previously occupied. Coincidentally—or not—it was the same place in which Cèline, her daughter, was sitting. The girl looked at him not unlike a curious cat sizing up a stranger. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She was the spitting image of her mother, save for the shorter hair. However, the color, a silvery-white, was the same, as well as the amber eyes and the almost pale skin. Few would guess she spent her days practicing with a rapier, Cèline’s skills being the only thing keeping the house relevant. If not for that convenience, the Froir would have long since lost their noble status.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline stood, moving to another armchair farther from her mother, but still keeping her gaze on Yao.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">A cup of water and two teacups were set on the table. He took his, briefly swirling the liquid, a habit and an unnecessary precaution, before drinking.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“You know, Commander…” Isabeau spoke again. “Lately, I have been feeling increasingly uneasy.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Her voice was low, almost as if she needed to whisper.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, panting. Looking at the stars has always calmed me since I was little, so I open the window when that happens. But do you know what I see?”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She paused, giving him time to guess.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Someone far away, looking at me. And sometimes, something glinting in the moonlight next to them.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She stopped once more, drinking her tea, though her grip was tighter.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“I believe someone is planning to kill me or Cèline. And, given our circumstances, I don’t doubt that is case. With the smallest push, we would lose everything.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao rested his cup, narrowing his eyes.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“That’s a bold claim.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“I would never say something like that with no reason, Commander, and I trust you are wise enough to understand why I bring it to you.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Oh, how many times had he heard the same.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“I propose an exchange.” Isabeau gestured towards Cèline. “My daughter is my most prized possession, and you must be aware of her abilities. I dare say that she is worth more <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>than a dozen of your men.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Would my side of this trade be that dozen of soldiers?” Yao asked, resting his head on the palm of his hand. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Isabeau shook her head.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Of course not, I would feel terrible in taking so many from you. I would like just a small contigent, one that wouldn`t be missed. Enough to patrol the region and keep us safe until the conspirators retreat.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao glanced at Cèline. She hadn’t reacted to anything at all.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“An interesting proposal. But what if the worst happened and your daughter dies before I see any benefit from this deal? We have a lot planned, including a risky operation very soon.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Then she would never amount to anything to begin with,” the matriarch answered without missing a beat. “But, of course, I would not insult you with such a gamble. You see—”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">A relayer rang on the table besides Isabeau, the device’s screen flashing brightly. She sighed, setting down her cup as she rose from her chair. “Excuse me,” she murmured before leaving the room with it, leaving Yao and Cèline alone.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">That was pitiful. He didn’t expect much to come from that meeting, but her negotiation attempt was mediocre at best. There was no threat. The contenders for the Froir house’s substitute would not waste resources just to rush the inevitable. Isabeau only wanted the Imperial Army’s presence to pass a message, and throwing “her most prized possession” out as part of the bargain was too reckless. </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Despite being called that, Cèline didn’t seem even remotely disturbed. Her posture was still impeccable, her hands were elegantly over the armrests and she was still quiet.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Well,” she spoke, almost as if reading Yao’s thoughts, “that was interesting, wasn’t it, Commander?”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Interesting?” Yao eyed her carefully. “You must have quite the stomach to think so.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline shrugged, unbothered</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“If I hadn’t, things would have gone differently a long time ago.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“How so?”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">No response.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline stood up, smoothing a had down her dress, brushing away a nonexistent wrinkle.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“She might take some time. Would you like a tour of the mansion?”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Sure,” Yao replied, following her to the nearby staircase.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">The second floor wasn’t much different from the first, though it had a few more corridors winding through it. They continued forward, Cèline’s steps not making even the faintest sound despite the complete silence. She opened a door to the left and went inside.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“This is my favorite room. I like to come here to wind down sometimes,” Cèline commented, closing the door behind them.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">At first glance, it was normal, similar to the one they were previously in.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">The problem lied in the minor details, indistinguishable unless someone was either really perceptive or a perfectionist. Light reflected off of nothing, some floorboards were uneven – not from wear, but on purpose, – faint glints of something lurked behind the frames and beneath the carpets. And then, a slight scent of oil.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline walked calmly, unbothered, her hand lightly resting on top of the rapier that always kept her company. She sat on one of the chairs close to the central table and crossed her legs, looking at Yao as if saying “go on, walk.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao inhaled, slowly and controlled. He could have left the room, but it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to assume it was somehow rigged. Besides, crossing that labyrinth could be </span><em><span class="s4">entertaining</span></em><span class="s3">.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">With the first step, his boot landed mere inches from a sketchy floorboard. Another one, and the side of his coat grazed an almost invisible wire.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">His fingers brushed the edge of a nearby chair. Hollow. Too light. Not safe.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Next. Heavier. Solid. Safe. But the floor around him was not, nor was the distorting light.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">If that was her favorite room, then she didn’t want him to also relax.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao let himself step a little too far. His throat brushed another semi-invisible wire. It felt like the kiss of a blade. A single movement and it would carve into flesh. He froze, heartbeat steady, before carefully stepping back.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Across the room, Cèline lazily tapped her foot against the floor. A barely audible </span><em><span class="s4">click </span></em><span class="s3">followed</span><em><span class="s4">. </span></em><span class="s3">The wire snapped into his neck. Yao arched back just in time. A strand of black hair fluttered to the ground.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline tilted her head.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“What’s wrong, Commander?”, she asked, her voice flat, almost curious.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao straightened, rolling his shoulders.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Nothing much.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">She hummed softly.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao moved again, checking the rest of the furniture. One chair was too light. A couch was firm, but shifted oddly – it could be a weak leg or something underneath it. The table was sturdy, but on a warped floorboard. Every possible place seemed like a death sentence.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Only one place was safe. The spot she sat in.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Yao quickly looked over the remaining spots. Too far.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Soon, he was right in front of her. He smiled.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“You know,” Yao said. “I saw somewhere that standing up is great for your health.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cèline blinked.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Is that so?” </span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">“Yes. Improves circulation, keeps your spine aligned and helps you stay alert. I think I’m fine with standing up for now.”</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Nothing.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Then—Cèline rose.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Cold steel pierced through his shoulder. Yao did not scream.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">His own blood stained the carpet in slow drops.</span></p>
      <p class="ps4"><span class="s3">And he saw her smile for the first time that day.</span></p>
